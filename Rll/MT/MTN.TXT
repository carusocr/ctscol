							Notes for using "macro" style mt rlls.
1. The rll file is mtnf.c. 
The file mtn.c was generated by using mkntrll.exe on mtn.def.
2. mtnlib.c is a new file which can be used to create mtnlib.lib 
library (project mtnlib.dsw) to link with the main project (mtn.dsw) 
to support the functions called in the macro.
